      <div class="poem">
        <p>Find a snowy forest, walk into it<br>
          Forget the way you came in and don’t leave a trail<br>
          Pretend you’ve been in the forest for years<br>
          Forget your mom and dad and brother<br>
          Get your socks all wet from walking so long in the snow (the worse feeling ever)<br>
          Endure your empty stomach<br>
          Feel that you are an orphan<br>
          Look for a witch’s cabin<br>
          If you can’t find one repeat the above steps all over again<br>
          When you find the cabin make sure noone is there<br>
          Go inside and get comfortable<br>
          Light a fire<br>
          Warm up her stew (for you)<br>
          Find the small blue egg hidden in the house<br>
          Hold it tight before the fireplace and warm it up<br>
          Protect the egg incase someone comes<br>
          After 5 days the egg is yours<br>
          When the egg wiggles it will be ready to hatch<br>
          Pointy black hairs, mischievous eyes and a snort should greet you through the cracks <br>
          Peel off the debris and put them in your pocket<br> 
          Bundle the oily babe and carry it to the water basin<br> 
          In warm (NOT lukewarm) water gently wipe the egg slime from between his toes<br>
          Make sure it doesn’t hop out the tub<br>
          Move towards the muffles and clean the creases and folds<br> 
          Clear the large eyes and snout from any remaining gunk
          Wrap up the tot in a soft dry cloth<br>
          Find a piece of licorice in an unlocked drawer<br>
          Feed it half and save the rest for the road<br>
          Tiptoe out the door with the creation pressed to your chest<br>
          Make your way out from the woods<br>
          And this path remember for good <br>
          Back to your mom and dad and brother (bleugh)<br>
          Conceal the secret you just found <br>
          Listen close to it’s breath as it sleeps safe and sound<br>
          Don't rush to decipher its yips and yaps<br>
          The myth is inscribed in its quiet song <br>
